WebsocketRails::EventMap.describe do
  # You can use this file to map incoming events to controller actions.
  # One event can be mapped to any number of controller actions. The
  # actions will be executed in the order they were subscribed.
  #
  # Uncomment and edit the next line to handle the client connected event:
  subscribe :room_channel, :to => RoomsController, :with_method => :show
  #
  # Here is an example of mapping namespaced events:
  #   namespace :product do
  #     subscribe :new, :to => ProductController, :with_method => :new_product
  #   end
  # The above will handle an event triggered on the client like `product.new`.
  
  # subscribe :room_channel, 'rooms#show'
  # config.middleware.delete Rack::Lock
  # mount ActionCable.server => '/cable'
  
end
